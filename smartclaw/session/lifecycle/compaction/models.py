DEFAULT_COMPACTION_PROMPT = """\
Summarize the conversation above into a structured compaction summary. \
The new session will NOT have access to the original conversation, so \
preserve all information needed to continue seamlessly.

Your summary MUST include these sections (use exact headings):

## Decisions
Key decisions made during the conversation (architecture choices, \
approaches selected, trade-offs accepted).

## Current Task
What is currently being worked on — the active goal and its status.

## Open TODOs
Remaining tasks, unresolved issues, or next steps that were planned \
but not yet completed. Use a checklist format.

## Key Files & Identifiers
Exact file paths, function/class/variable names, API endpoints, \
configuration keys, or other identifiers referenced in the conversation. \
Preserve these EXACTLY — do not paraphrase or abbreviate.

## Constraints & Context
Important constraints, user preferences, project conventions, or \
environmental details that affect future work.

Rules:
- Keep the same language as the conversation.
- Be factual — only include information explicitly present in the conversation.
- Preserve exact identifiers (paths, names, commands) without modification.
- Omit sections that have no content rather than writing "None".
